Business objective

#Objective
In this hypothesis report we used the data from the Autolib electric car-sharing service company. The variable that we majorly dealt with is the number of blue cars that were returned on Monday and Friday. 
The objective of this hypothesis was to find whether there is no statistical difference between the mean of blue cars taken on monday and friday and this was our null hypothesis. Our alternate hypothesis was a statistical difference between the mean of blue cars taken on monday and friday.
This hypothesis was chosen because we wanted to know the day which we had most customers so as to increase the availability of resources on that day and also to find which day was critical to the company,  is it at the beginning of the weekday or at the end of the weekday.
